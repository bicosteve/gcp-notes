REGIONS & ZONES
- regions are used to avoid latency for application users
- this creates slow access to users 
- applications should be deployed in more than one region and they should be near the users to avoid latency 
- applications served from more than one region will solve the problem of if data center goes offline, the other 
  will still have a back up. 
- this creates high availability and low latency .
- 

1. Regions 
- gcp provides 20 + regions around the world. 
- region is specific geographic location to hold your resources.
- eg mumbai, london, sidney region 
- applications deployed in multiple regions leads to high availability.
- low latency is also solved since users will be served with resources near them. 
- global availability and frontprint 
- adherance to government regulation eg data related to US customers should only be housed in US regions 
- 

2. Zones 
- in regions, there are multiple zones 
- in gcp there are atleast 3 zones in a region 
- this creates increased availability and fault tolerance within the same region 
- application can be deployed to any of the zones so that even if one zone is offline, the other remaining zones 
    will still serve the application. 
- each of these zones has one or more discrete clusters. Where a cluster is distinct physical infrastructure that is 
    housed in a data center.
- zones in regions are connected through low-latency links. 
- eg application deployed in zone 1 and the db deployed in zone 2 will create a good performance. 
- eg us-west1 The Dallas,Oregon, North America 3 Zones, us-west1-a, us-west1-b,us-west1-c
