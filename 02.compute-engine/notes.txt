GCP COMPUTE ENGINE
 - Overview 
 - 1. how to create virtual marchine
 - 2. understand marchine types and images
 - 3. installing http servers in the compute engine virtual marchine 
 - 4. understanding internal and external ips
 - 5. playing with static ip addresses
 - 6. understanding static ip address in gcp 


 - applications are deployed in servers 
 - in the cloud, applications are deployed in virtual servers 
 - this is where the compute engine come in. 
 - these virtual marchines are rented. 
 - virtual machines are virtual servers in GCP 
 - compute engine provision and manage the virtual machines 
 - compute engine helps you to create and manage lifecyle of Virtual Machine Instances. 
 - can implement load balancing and auto scaling for multiple vm machines 
 - allows to attach storage to vms 
 - allows to manage network connectivity and configuration to vm instances

 Compute Engine Machine Family 
 1. Hardware - has machine family and machine type 
    different machines families are for different work loads 
    a) General Purpose(E2, N2, N2D, N1) best price-performance ration 
    are for web applications severs, small medium databse, dev environment
    b) Memory Optimized(M2,M1) have ultra high memeory workloads.
        best for in-memory databases and in-memory analytics 

    c)Compute Optimized (C2): compute intensive workloads.
     run gaming applications, 

- variety of machine types are available for each machine family 
- example e2-standard-2
-> e2 - machine type family 
-> standar - type of workload 
-> 2 - number of CPUs 
The higher the memory, disk, and networking capabilities increases along with vCPUs

2. Image - this is the operating system and what software one needs to  the instance 
Type of Images 
    a) Public Images - provided & maintained by Google or Open source communities or third party vendors
    b) Custom Images - created by you for your projects
