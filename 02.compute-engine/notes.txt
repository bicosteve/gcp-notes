GCP COMPUTE ENGINE
 - Overview 
 - 1. how to create virtual marchine
 - 2. understand marchine types and images
 - 3. installing http servers in the compute engine virtual marchine 
 - 4. understanding internal and external ips
 - 5. playing with static ip addresses
 - 6. understanding static ip address in gcp 

a) 
 - applications are deployed in servers 
 - in the cloud, applications are deployed in virtual servers 
 - this is where the compute engine come in. 
 - these virtual marchines are rented. 
 - virtual machines are virtual servers in GCP 
 - compute engine provision and manage the virtual machines 
 - compute engine helps you to create and manage lifecyle of Virtual Machine Instances. 
 - can implement load balancing and auto scaling for multiple vm machines 
 - allows to attach storage to vms 
 - allows to manage network connectivity and configuration to vm instances 
 - 

 b) Compute Engine Machine Family 
 1. Hardware - has machine family and machine type 
    different machines families are for different work loads 
    a) General Purpose(E2, N2, N2D, N1) best price-performance ration 
    are for web applications severs, small medium databse, dev environment
    b) Memory Optimized(M2,M1) have ultra high memeory workloads.
        best for in-memory databases and in-memory analytics 

    c)Compute Optimized (C2): compute intensive workloads.
     run gaming applications, 

- variety of machine types are available for each machine family 
- example e2-standard-2
-> e2 - machine type family 
-> standar - type of workload 
-> 2 - number of CPUs 
The higher the memory, disk, and networking capabilities increases along with vCPUs

2. Image - this is the operating system and what software one needs to  the instance 
Type of Images 
    a) Public Images - provided & maintained by Google or Open source communities or third party vendors
    b) Custom Images - created by you for your projects 


c) Ip Addresses 
1. External IP - are internet accessible. Can reach the machine through a browser.
2. Internal IP - are internal to a corporate network. Can only be used inside google cloud network 
NB: Two resources cannot have the same external ip addresses. 
Two different corporate networks can have resources with the same Internal IP address. 
All VM instances are assigned atleast one Internal IP address.
When a vm instance is stopped, the external ip address is lost 
To get a constant ip address, you can use static pi address
This is found in VPC Network tab 
Click on 'Reserve Static Address'
The ip address becomes static and can be assigned to a virtual machine 
click on 'Reassign to another resource'

NB: Static IP Address
1. can be switched from one vm instance to another vm instance
2. it remains attached even if the instance is stopped 
3. static ip is billed both when using and when using it. Release static ip which you are not using 

d) Simplify VM HTTP Server Setup 
- how do we reduce steps in creating vm instance 
- 1. using startup script 
     - Bootstrapping: install OS patches or software when a vm instance is launched.
     - in the virtual machine you can configure startup script to bootstrap
     - create a vm -> management-security-disk networking -> startup script
     - write the exact script and create
     -  

- 2. instance template 
     - instance template defines machine type, image, labels, startup script and other properties
     - used to create vm instances and instance groups
     - CANNOT be updated 
     - it can also specify image family eg debian-9
     - if family is not specified, the latest non deprecated image family is used 
     - go to vm instances -> instance templates -> create new instance template -> management -> start up script -> create 
- 3. custom image 
     - reduces launch time. 
     - can be created from vm instance, persistent disk, snapshot, another image, or a file in Cloud Storage 
     - recommendation is customize images to your corporate security standards. (Hardening Image)
     - prefer custom image to startup script 
     - in vm -> disk -> actions -> create image -> create 
     NB: should never create image from a disk on a running instance. 

e) Debug Problems in VM 
- make sure to use external ip 
- ssh into the machine 
- make sure packages are well installed 
- check content with 'cat' commands 
-
