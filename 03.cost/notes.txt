1. Sustained Use Discounts
- it is automatic discounts for running vm instances for significant portion of the billing month.
- example, for n1,n2 machine types, use for more than 25% of a month you get 20% to 50% discount on every 
    incremental minute. 
- the discount increases with usage 
- no action is required on your part. 
- it is applicable for instances created by kubernetes engine and compute engine 
- RESTRICTION: does not apply on certain machine types like E2 & A2. 
- also does not apply to vms created by App Engine flexible and Dataflow 
- are automatically applied for GKE and Compute Engine 

2. Commited Use Discounts 
- recommended for workloads with predictable resource needs.
- can commit for 1 year or 3 years.
- you will get upto 70% discount based on machine type and GPUs.
- applicable for instances created by GKE and Compute Engines 
- restricted for vms created by App Engine flexible and Dataflow. 

3. Preemptible VMs 
- are short lived cheaper ( upto 80% ) compute instances. 
- can be stopped by GCP any time (preemted) within 24 hours. 
- instances get 30 seconds warning to save anything they want to save. 
- use preemptive vms when;
    1. your applications are fault tolerant
    2. you are very cost sensitive. 
    3. your workload is not immediate. 
    4. eg non immediate batch processing jobs
- Restrictions: 
    - not always available.
    - no sla and cannot be migrated to regular vm 
    - no automatic restart them 
    - free tier credits are not applicable 
NB: Lasts only 24 hours 

4. Spot VMs 
- they are the latest versions of preemptible VMs 
- different from preemptible vms in that, they have no maximum runtime like preemptible vms
- other features are similar to preemptible vms 
- not always available. 
- dynamic pricing from 60% to 91% discount compared to on demand VMs 
- Free Tier credits not applicable. 
- 

5. Compute Engine Billing 
- you are billed by seconds (after a minimum of 1 minute)
- you are not billed for compute whne the compute instance is stopped 
- you however, you will be billed for any storage attached to it. 
RECOMMENDATION: always create 'Budget Alerts' and make use of budget exports to stay on top of billing. 
- On Navigation, pick billings -> budget & alerts. 
- you can  reate budget alerts and email billing to admins and users when charges exceed certain amount.
- 

6. Compute Engine:Live Miration & Availability Policy
- how do you keep your vm instaces running when a host system needs to be updated(software or hardware needs to be updated)
- compute engine provide a feature called Live Migration 
- here, your running instance will be migrated to another host in the same zone.
- Does not change any attribute or the properties of the VM 
- supported for instances local SSDs 
- not supported for GPUs and preemtible instances. 
Important Configuration - Availability Policy 
- this is where live migration is configured 
- on host maintenance:configures what should happen during periodic infrastructure maintenance. 
    1. The default is migrate to another host 
    2. terminate the instance
    3. automatic restart - restarts vm instance if they are terminated due to non-user-initiated reasons.  
- 

7. Compute Engine Features: Custom Machine Types 
- what do you do when predefined VM options are NOT appropriate?
- you can create a machine type customized to your needs. (Custom Machine Type)
- they adjust vCPUs , memory and GPUs. The choice is between E2, N2, or N1 machine types only. 
- supports various OS eg CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Windows etc.
- it is billed per vCPUs and memory provisioned to each instance.
- to configure a custom vm; 
vm instance -> new vm instance -> machine type -> custom 

8. Compute Engine Features 
    a) GPUs
    - Graphic Processing Unit
    - used for accelerateing math intensive and graphics-intensive workloads for AI/ML etc 
    - Adds a GPU to your VM 
    - gives high performance for math intensive and graphic intensive workloads 
    - has higher cost 
    NB: Use images with GPU libraries (Deep Learning) installed. If not, your GPU will not be used 
    GPU Restrictions: 
    - not supported on all machine types. (Not supported on shared-core or memory-optimized machine types)
    - on host maintenance, it will be a terminated vm instance. 
    - recommended availability policy for GPUs is automatic restart-on 
    - 

9. VMs Nota Benas
- a virtual machine is associated with a project.
- machine type availability vary from region to region 
- you can only change the machine type when it is stopped. 
- vms can be filtered by their properties. can be name, zone or machine type, network tabs, labels, status. 
- instances are created on specific zones
- images are global
- instance templates are also global 
- automatic basing monitoring is enable on every vm. 
- 

10. VM - Best Practices
- choose right zone and right region. This is based on const, regulation,availability, latency, and hardware needs. 
- distribute instances in multiple zones, regions for high availability. 
- choose right machine types for your needs. 
- play with them to find out the right machine type 
- use gpu for math and graphic intensive apps 
- for applications running for a long time, use 'committed use discounts' for constant work loads
- for fault tolerant workload use preemptible instances 
- use labels to indicate environment, team, business unit etc 
- 

11. Compute Engine Scenarios 
a) Prerequesite to create VM instances 
- project 
- billing account 
- Compute Engine Enabled 
- 
b) You want dedicated hardware for compliance, licensing, and management needs.
- search sole-tenant node 
- 
c) I have 1000 VMs I want to automate OS patch management 
- go to VM Manager, OS patch management 

c) Log into VM instance and install software 
- use SSH to log into the machine 

d) You do not want to expose VM to internet 
- DO NOT assign external IP addresses 
- configure firewall rules 
- disable http traffic and https traffic 

12. Review 
Image - OS and what software 
Machine Types - optimized combinantion of compute(CPU, GPU), memory disk (storage) and networking for workloads. Can custom VM 
Sustained use discounts: Automatic discounts for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month 
Committed use discounts: 1 year or 3 year reservations for workloads with predictable resource needs.
Preemptible Vm short lived cheaper upto 80% for non time critical fault tolerant workloads.
