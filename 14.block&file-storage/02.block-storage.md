Block Storage

- this is hard disk attached to your computers.
- typically, one block storage device can be connected to One Virtual server.
- there are exceptions where you can attach a read only block devices with multiple virtual servers and certain cloud providers are exploring multi-writer disk.
- you can also attach multiple different block storage devices to one virtual server.
- block storage can be used as;
  a) Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) - Similar to a hard disk.
  b) Storage Area Network (SAN) - High speed network connecting a pool of storage devices.
- are made use by high performing servers.

GCP Block Storage

1. Local SSDs.

- are present on same same host as your virtual machine.
- they are local blcok storage.
- has temporary data.
- their life cycle is tied to the VM instance.
- they are physically attached to host VM instance.
- provide very high IOPs and very low latency.
- it is an ephemeral storage in that data is held temporarily.
- enable live migration for data to survice maintenance events.
- data is automatically encypted and you cannot configure encryption keys.
- not all machines support local ssds.
- for better performance ssd, use larger ssds that is with more storage

Advantages of Local SSDs.

- very fast i/o 100x faster compared to persistent disks.
- high throughput and lower latency.
- ideal for use cases which require high IOPs while storing temporary information eg cache, temporary data, scratch files etc.

Disadvantages

- it is ephemeral in that it has low durability, low availability, low flexibility compared to persistent disks.
- you cannot attach and detach it from or to another VM instance.

2. Persistent Disks

- network block storage attached to your VM instance.
- it is provisioned that is you need to configure how much you want.
- it is very flexible that is you can increase it when needed when attached to vm instances.
- performance scale with size in that the more storage you have the higher the performance.
- has independent life cycle that is you can attach and detach from one VM instance to another.
- has regional and optional options.
- zonal persistent disks are replicated in a single zone.
- regional persistent disks are replicated in two zones in the same region.
- regional persistent disks are 2x costlier than the zonal persistent disks.
- can store two types of persistent disk storage.
  i) zonal - Data replicated in one zone.
  ii) regional - Data replicated in multiple zones.
- high availability data should be stored in regional disk storages.
- they are network storage that is they can be in another region.
- they are more durable.
- their life cycle is not tied to the VM instance.
- can be disconnected from on VM and attached to another vm instance.
- typical use case of persistent disk is if you want to run your custom database.

Persistent Disk - Snapshots

- takes a point in time backup snapshots of your Persistent Disks.
- you can also schedule snapshots (configure schedule of your snapshots)
- you can auto delete snap shots after x days
- they can be multi regional and regional
- the snapshots are backups of your persistent disks.
- you can share snapshots across projects
- you can create new disks and instances from the snapshots
- snapshots are incremental meaning it will only take snaps of data that are not already in the snapshot
- deleting a snapshot only deletes data which is not needed by other snapshots.
- keep similar data together on a persistent disk.
- separate your operating system, volatile, and permanent data
- attach multiple disks if needed.
- helps to better organize your snapshots and images.
  NB;
- avoid taking snapshots more often than once an hour.
- disk volume is available for use but snapshots reduce performance.
- schedule snapshots during off peak hours.
- creating snapshots from disk is faster than creating images; but creating disks from images is faster than creating snapshots.
- snapshots are incremental but you dont lose data by deleting older snapshots
- deleting snapshots only deletes data which is not needed by other snapshots
- do not hesitate to delete unnecessary snapshots.
  NB: You can choose to select 'Keep Boot Disk' on Deletion Rule. The default is Delete boot disk.
  You can schedule a snapshot and attach the schedule on the persistent disk.

Machine Images

- machine image is a compute engine resource that stores configs, metadata, permissions, and data from multiple disks of VM instance.
- machine image is different from image
- an image contains an operating system that is used to boot your VM.
- it is created from a VM instance
- contains everything you will need to create a vm instance.
- it contains everything you need to create an instance.
- recommended for disk backups, instance cloning and replication.
- you can create a machine image from the VM then create another instance from the machine image created.
- this is possible because it contains all the resources needed to create a VM instance.

Disks From The Command Line
**gcloud compute disks create/list/delete/resize/snapshot**
create disk
gcloud compute disk create <disk-name> --zone=us-east1-a --size=1TB --type=pd-ssd
check the disk type lists with;
gcloud compute disk-types list
what should be on the disk?
--image --image-family --source-disk --source-snapshot
how should data be encrypted
--kms-key --kms-project

**gcloud compute disks resize example-disk-1 --size=6TB**
this will resize the example-disk-1 to 6TB
disk sizes can only be increased

**gcloud compute disks snapshot <disk-name> --zone=us-central1-a --snapshot-name=snapshot-test**
gcloud compute snapshot list/delete/describe

Images From The Command Line
gcloud compute images
**Create Images**
gcloud compute images create <image-name>
gcloud compute images create test-one-image --source-disk=<disk-name> --zone=<zone-name>
remember it is images/disks/instances
From Disk;
gcloud compute images create test-one-image --source-disk=<disk-name> --zone=<zone-name>
From Snapshot
gcloud compute images create test-one-image --source-snapshot=<source-snapshot> --zone=<zone-name>
From another image;
gcloud compute images create test-one-image --source-image=<disk-name> --source-image-project=<source-image-project> --zone=<zone-name>
**Deprecating Image**
this is to remove an old image to a new image
gcloud compute images deprecate IMAGE --state=DEPRECATED
**Exports Virtual Disk Images**
gcloud compute images export --image=my-image --destination-uri=<url> --export-format=vdk --project=my-project
**Delete Image**
gcloud compute images delete my-image-1 my-image-2

Storage Scenarios - Persistent Disks

1. Improve Performance of Persistent Disks;
   Sln: Increase the size of the PD or add more PDs. Increase vCPUs in your VM.

2. Increase Durability of your Persistent Disks;
   Go for regional PDs (2x the cost but replicated in 2 zones)

3. Take Hourly Backup of your Persistent Disk;
   Take snapshot of your persistent disk with an hourly schedule.

4. Delete Old Snapshots Created by Scheduled Snapshots;
   Set an auto deletiton of snapshots and specify the days/hours/months
   Configure as part of scheduling of snapshots
